                Welcome, disciple, to the lexicon of the Gherkin. Within you will find access to the 
            collective knowledge on the Gherkin, ally of man, enemy of Gnome. Read on to delve into their
            secretive history, and learn how to live alongside our minute friends. Soon, perhaps, you may 
            even meet a Gherkin in the flesh.

        <button onclick="expandText('Drpdwn2')" class="dropbtn">What is a Gherkin?</button>
        <div id="Drpdwn2" class="dropdown-content">
            The Gherkin is a small creature which lives deep within tall grasses and great 
            swaths of nature. They taught man to plow the fields and grow life from seeds.
            They ride toads and frogs as men ride steeds, and oft depicted in combat with creatures
            such as snails. This is, in fact, the origin of Byzantine era paintings of warriors
            battling snails, though the Gherkins were poorly represented as many artists 
            commissioned could not see a Gherkin. They were likely told the Gherkin resembled a 
            'very small man'. <br>

        <button onclick="expandText('Drpdwn3')" class="dropbtn">Why should I hate the Gnome?</button>
        <div id="Drpdwn3" class="dropdown-content">
            A common misconception about the Gnome is gained from the common garden gnome. Why,
            indeed, should we hate a creature that we place around our gardens? Are they not an
            ally to the Gherkin? They are often believed to be a protective charm. <br>
            Whilst the garden gnome is indeed a protective charm to the garden, this is not 
            because the gnome is inherently good. The garden gnome is, in fact, taking advantage
            of one of the two only emotions a Gnome can feel. These being 'hate' and 'fear'. 
            The garden gnome is a warning. A show of dominance. It exhibits to the gnomes what
            will certainly happen to them if they tread upon this territory. They will avoid the
            garden because of this, taking with them their mealy worms and other parasites.
