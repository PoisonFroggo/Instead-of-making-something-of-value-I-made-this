So long as this is allowed, I've decided that my major free-form assignments will just be adding on to this current website I made for the last
assignment. I understand that might be frustrating to look for the requirements that were fulfilled if it gets too big, so this will serve
as a sort of changelog, explaining which file fulfills the assignment requirements. For the Unit 3 assessment, all requirements should be
fulfilled by the file Pistachio_secret_JS and pistachio_secrets.html. Please do note that none of the things brought up in either files are
things I believe, and I do not need medical help. This is a joke, and something I do because it's personally entertaining.
