The site is formatted into a relatively simple little game in which the user can interact with certain sites in limited ways.
The Gherkin in the beginning has a key in their mouth, pressing on the key will remove the key and add it to the user's 'inventory', which is
then displayed at the bottom of the screen. A webpage is either known or unknown, it may become known if the user types the proper string to
enter the webpage or naturally progresses to it through hitting buttons on the various pages. Their known pages appear in the corner and clicking
on one will bring the user to it. 

	Items:
Gun: The gun displays a 2D sprite of a hand holding a gun over the cursor. Clicking with the gun allows the user to shoot the gun.
Key: It opens a single door. Each key opens any door, with only one use before it breaks.
