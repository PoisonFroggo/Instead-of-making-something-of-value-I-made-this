            Welcome acolyte, this is the place of the gnomes. You have shown your intellect by choosing
            to praise the might gnome. This decision will be one you shan't forget, nor regret. Here we, 
            the gnomes, will share our knowledge with you in the many strifes of the modern world. We 
            show how to save money, disposal of hazards, using machines, and even more!

        <h1>Safe Disposal of Oil</h1>
        <div>
            To safely dispose of oil, dig a hole approximately two feet deep and three inches in diameter.
             Fill this hole with gravel, sand, or another loose material similar. Pour the oil into this 
             hole where it will safely be absorbed into the earth and be carried away by water runoff.
        </div>
        <h1>Saving Money While Shopping</h1>
        <div>
            When shopping you may notice that many items will be priced rather high compared to what you 
            personally value it as. This is because the large corporations you frequent cannot sustain a 
            low price for all of their many products. Assist them by signing up for every credit card, 
            rewards program, and other things they offer to help you lower prices and help them keep track 
            of your spending habits. This helps you not only save money, but allows them to monitor your 
            spending for suspicious activity, causing others to be unable to use your money in illicit 
            methods.
