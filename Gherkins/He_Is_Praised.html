                Welcome, and congratulations on resisting the influence of the devilish gnomes by praising 
                the Gherkin.     
            Welcome, disciple, to the lexicon of the Gherkin. Within you will find access to the 
            collective knowledge on the Gherkin, ally of man, enemy of Gnome. Read on to delve into their
            secretive history, and learn how to live alongside our minute friends. Soon, perhaps, you may 
            even meet a Gherkin in the flesh.

        <button onclick="expandText('Drpdwn2')" class="dropbtn">What is a Gherkin?</button>
        <div id="Drpdwn2" class="dropdown-content">
            The Gherkin is a small creature which lives deep within tall grasses and great 
            swaths of nature. They taught man to plow the fields and grow life from seeds.
            They ride toads and frogs as men ride steeds, and oft depicted in combat with creatures
            such as snails. This is, in fact, the origin of Byzantine era paintings of warriors
            battling snails, though the Gherkins were poorly represented as many artists 
            commissioned could not see a Gherkin. They were likely told the Gherkin resembled a 
            'very small man'. <br>

        <button onclick="expandText('Drpdwn3')" class="dropbtn">Why should I hate the Gnome?</button>
        <div id="Drpdwn3" class="dropdown-content">
            A common misconception about the Gnome is gained from the common garden gnome. Why,
            indeed, should we hate a creature that we place around our gardens? Are they not an
            ally to the Gherkin? They are often believed to be a protective charm. <br>
            Whilst the garden gnome is indeed a protective charm to the garden, this is not 
            because the gnome is inherently good. The garden gnome is, in fact, taking advantage
            of one of the two only emotions a Gnome can feel. These being 'hate' and 'fear'. 
            The garden gnome is a warning. A show of dominance. It exhibits to the gnomes what
            will certainly happen to them if they tread upon this territory. They will avoid the
            garden because of this, taking with them their mealy worms and other parasites. <br>
            Now many you know may certainly have become influenced by the silvered tongue of the 
            Gnome. They offer much, and deliver on even more. You may view your friends and they 
            appear happy, content. So how could the gnomes be such devils, if they fulfill their 
            promises?

        <button onclick="expandText('Drpdwn4')" class="dropbtn">The devil never lies</button>
        <div id="Drpdwn4" class="dropdown-content">
            There is a phrase known to many in our circle, the phrase is simple. The Devil never 
            lies. The devil offers fruits of joy. He opens the gates of a veritable Eden of pleasure, 
            and you may indeed freely pick of its fruits. In this way, the gnome is much like the devil. 
            They promised the intelligent science. They promised the fearful and uncertain security and 
            they promised the sick sterility. As you can see, we live in such a world today. Man is rich, 
            richer than he has ever been. However, wealth in material is all the gnome can offer. <br>
            Our world is filled with science at the expense of our spirituality. Intellect is chosen 
            before wisdom. Security is offered at the expense of constant surveillance. Sterility is given 
            at the expense of our health. They have offered us, and you, a quick way to immediately gain 
            something without effort. Anything gained without effort is gained without certainty. <br>
            The Gherkin has not taught us this directly. They haven't a language complex enough to convey 
            such notions or ideas. The Gherkin has taught us in the best way that any teacher can. Rather 
            than show us the answer before the question, they gave us a situation. They gave us a problem, 
            and gave us the path to the solution. The solution was reached by us, and thus the solution was 
            earned.
