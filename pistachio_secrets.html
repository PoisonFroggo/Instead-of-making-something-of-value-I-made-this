            When eating a pistachio, you may notice a rather strange hole in the center. This is something I brushed
            off initially, as you surely have. However, the fact that you are here means your mind is an inquisitive one,
            and considering such a thing, you have certainly noted that not all pistachios in the bag have these holes.
            There is a simple reason for this. The same reason for most suspicious things you find in everyday life.

        <h1>Government surveillance</h1>
        <div>
            This data came to me in a dream from the lord, where Gabriel the angel spoke to me. He
            told me of the antichrist and his methods, and the most overlooked of these methods was
            the Pistachio Surveillance System, which will be referred to as the PSS from here on out.
            These holes are small areas where the feds place miniscule chips. These chips do track,
            of course. There is little use for the knowledge of the location, as there is no camera
            and therefore no way to know the individual, but the sucklers at the teat of Mammon will 
            take every drop of innocence they can drink. The chips and their main function are to
            track movement, dietary habits, and health problems. It, to an extent, treats them. After
             all, a sick slave cannot labor. 
        </div>
        <h1>Dietary surveillance</h1>
        <div>
            Now, a big question I often get is the following: "Why does the government want to
             collect dietary info?" <br>
            Of course, this seems like something that would be a good idea. Having a large amount
            of dietary info seems quite beneficial to the average person.
